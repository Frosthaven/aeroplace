# aeroplace

A helper utility for generating deterministic [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
application layouts on launch.

## Installation

```bash
brew tap frosthaven/aeroplace
brew install aeroplace
```

## Usage

aeroplace -w `<workspace>` -a `<application>` [-t `<title>`]

- workspace: The workspace identifier to place the application in
- application: The application name to launch (as seen in ``)
- title (optional): If provided, the command will wait until the application has
    this text in its title before considering the application launched (useful
    in cases like discord which have a launch screen)

*Note: This command will return the window id of the launchedlication. This
will allow you to feed the ID into other aerospace commands if desired.*

```bash
# Launch Slack and wait for the title to include '- Slack'
aeroplace -w '1' -a 'Slack' -t '- Slack'
```

## Example

```toml
after-startup-command = [
    # workspace 1 composition
    "exec-and-forget aeroplace -w 1 -a 'Zen Browser'; aeroplace -w 1 'WezTerm'",
    # wokspace 2 composition
    "exec-and-forget aeroplace -w 2 -a 'Slack'; aerospace move left --window-id $(aeroplace -w 2 -a 'Discord' -t '- Discord'); aerospace move right --window-id $(aeroplace -w '2' -a 'Obsidian' -t 'Obsidian')",
    # workspace 3 composition
    "exec-and-forget aeroplace '3' 'Microsoft Outlook' ' â€¢ '; aeroplace '3' 'ForkLift' ''",
]
```

## @todo

- [ ] Refactor to support named parameters
- [ ] Add support for startinglications OR commands
- [ ] Add parameters for move, join, and resize on new windows
- [ ] Add support for multiple windows of the samelication type
